# Implementation  of ML Model  for Image Classification

This Project presents the implementation of a Machine learning model for image Classification
Using #Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs).
I investigate the effectiveness of CNN architecture in recognizing and categorizing
images across multiple classes.The Project involves a comprehensive approach,beginning with data
acquistion and preprocessing to enhance image quality and ensure uniformality.
